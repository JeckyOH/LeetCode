### Hint

IMPORTANT: Find the difference between minimum value and following maximum value.

Thus,
1. Find the running mininum value and the difference between current value and current minimum value.
   - If current value is lower than minimum value, update minimum value.
   - Otherwise, if the difference between current value and minimum value is larger than current max difference, update the difference.
